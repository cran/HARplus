Description: Provides tools for processing and analyzing .har and .sl4 files, making it easier 
    for 'GEMPACK' users and 'GTAP' researchers to handle large economic datasets. 
    It simplifies the management of multiple experiment results, enabling faster 
    and more efficient comparisons without complexity. Users can extract, restructure, 
    and merge data seamlessly, ensuring compatibility across different tools. 
    The processed data can be exported and used in 'R', 'Stata', 'Python', 'Julia', or 
    any software that supports Text, CSV, or 'Excel' formats.
